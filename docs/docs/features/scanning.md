# Security Scanning

Cyber AI provides comprehensive security scanning capabilities powered by artificial intelligence. This guide explains the different types of scans available and how to use them effectively.

## Scan Types

### Vulnerability Scanning

Identifies security vulnerabilities in your applications and infrastructure:

- Web application vulnerabilities
- Network vulnerabilities
- Configuration issues
- Outdated software versions
- Known CVEs

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scans/vulnerability \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "target": "example.com",
    "options": {
      "depth": 3,
      "concurrent": 2
    }
  }'
```

### Network Scanning

Maps your network topology and identifies potential security issues:

- Open ports
- Running services
- Network architecture
- Potential entry points
- Misconfigured services

### Web Application Scanning

Analyzes web applications for security vulnerabilities:

- SQL injection
- XSS vulnerabilities
- CSRF issues
- Authentication flaws
- API security issues

### Cloud Infrastructure Scanning

Assesses cloud infrastructure security:

- IAM configurations
- Storage bucket permissions
- Network security groups
- Load balancer settings
- Kubernetes security

## Scan Configuration

### Depth Settings

Control how deep the scanner should analyze:

```json
{
  "options": {
    "depth": 3,  // 1-10, higher means deeper scan
    "concurrent": 2,  // Number of concurrent operations
    "timeout": 3600,  // Maximum scan duration in seconds
    "follow_redirects": true,  // Follow HTTP redirects
    "ignore_ssl": false  // Ignore SSL certificate errors
  }
}
```

### Scan Policies

Customize scan behavior with policies:

```json
{
  "policies": {
    "exclude_paths": ["/admin/*", "/api/internal/*"],
    "include_paths": ["/api/v1/*"],
    "max_requests_per_second": 10,
    "respect_robots_txt": true,
    "custom_headers": {
      "User-Agent": "CyberAI Scanner/1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

## AI-Powered Features

### Adaptive Scanning

The scanner automatically adjusts its behavior based on:

- Target response times
- Detected technologies
- Previous scan results
- Server behavior
- Error patterns

### Smart Detection

AI-enhanced vulnerability detection:

- Pattern recognition
- Anomaly detection
- Context-aware analysis
- Behavior analysis
- Zero-day detection

### Risk Scoring

Intelligent risk assessment based on:

- Vulnerability severity
- Business impact
- Exploit likelihood
- Attack complexity
- Required privileges

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with basic scans and gradually increase depth
2. **Regular Scanning**: Schedule periodic scans for continuous monitoring
3. **Policy Configuration**: Define clear scan policies and boundaries
4. **Resource Management**: Monitor system resources during scans
5. **Result Analysis**: Review and prioritize findings regularly

## Scan Results

Results are provided in multiple formats:

```json
{
  "scan_id": "scan_123abc",
  "status": "completed",
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "vuln_456def",
      "type": "vulnerability",
      "severity": "high",
      "title": "SQL Injection Vulnerability",
      "description": "...",
      "affected_component": "/api/users",
      "remediation": "...",
      "cvss_score": 8.5
    }
  ],
  "statistics": {
    "total_urls_scanned": 150,
    "total_vulnerabilities": 3,
    "scan_duration": 180,
    "requests_made": 1500
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Scan Timeout**
   - Increase timeout setting
   - Reduce scan depth
   - Optimize target selection

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Adjust concurrent requests
   - Implement request delays
   - Use rate limiting headers

3. **False Positives**
   - Review and update scan policies
   - Configure exclusion rules
   - Provide feedback for AI learning
